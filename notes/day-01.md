# Day 01

Today I focused on creating a simple system to maintain GitHub consistency.

## Key points
- One small contribution per day is enough
- Documentation counts as meaningful work
- Consistency matters more than speed
- Writing things down helps me think clearly

## Takeaway
Building a daily habit is more important than doing everything at once.
